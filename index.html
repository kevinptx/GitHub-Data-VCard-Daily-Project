        <p class="paragraph">I am a code school student learning to become a full stack web developer. My current area of focus is on HTML, CSS and Javascript. I hope to further build upon the skills acquired through this learning opportunity in order to become a future tech entrepreneur, who not only succeeds in the tech arena, but also comes up with tangible solutions to some of the major social inequalities and injustices that currently plague our society.</p>
